# Privacy Policy

Effective date: 2025-11-06

This Privacy Policy describes how **[Company/Developer Name]** ("we", "us", or "our") collects, uses, and shares information when you use **[App Name]** (the "App").

If you do not agree with this policy, please do not use the App. For questions, contact us at **[contact@email]**.

## 1. Summary
- **Purpose**: The App assists with IV drip monitoring using on-device computer vision.
- **Personal data**: We do not collect or sell personal information.
- **Camera use**: Video from your device camera is processed on-device to detect/measure drip flow.
- **Network use**: The App may access the internet for updates, licensing, or optional services; you can use core features offline.
- **Crash/analytics (optional)**: If enabled, we may receive anonymized diagnostics.

## 2. Information We Collect
Depending on your settings and device permissions, the App may process the following:

- **Camera imagery (required for functionality)**: Real-time frames are processed on-device to detect the IV drip chamber and estimate flow rate. Unless you explicitly save media, frames are not stored or transmitted.
- **App data you choose to save**: Flow measurements, session metadata, and preferences you choose to store locally. You may delete this from within the App (if supported) or by uninstalling the App.
- **Diagnostics and crash logs (optional)**: Pseudonymous logs (e.g., device model, OS version, App version, error traces). We use this to improve reliability. These logs do not include camera imagery.
- **Network metadata**: Standard network logs (timestamps, IP at connection) may be present transiently on servers used by distribution platforms or analytics providers.

We do not knowingly collect sensitive categories of personal data.

## 3. How We Use Information
- To provide core functionality: real-time IV drip detection and flow estimation.
- To maintain and improve performance, safety, and reliability.
- To fulfill legal obligations and enforce terms.

We do not use your information for advertising or profiling.

## 4. On-Device Processing and Storage
- Computer vision processing runs locally on your device.
- Camera frames are processed in memory and are not uploaded.
- Data you explicitly save (e.g., logs, preferences) is stored locally on your device unless you export or sync it through a service you control.

## 5. Permissions
The App may request the following permissions to operate:
- **Camera**: Required to analyze the IV drip chamber.
- **Photos/Media/Storage (optional)**: To save screenshots, logs, or exports when you choose to do so.
- **Network/Internet (optional)**: For updates, license checks, or optional diagnostics.

You can manage permissions in your device settings. Core features require camera access.

## 6. Data Retention
- Real-time camera frames: Not retained.
- Locally saved data: Retained on your device until you delete it or uninstall the App.
- Diagnostics/crash data (if enabled): Retained by our providers for a limited period consistent with their policies and our operational needs.

## 7. Sharing and Transfers
We do not sell your personal information.
We may share limited information:
- **Service providers**: For hosting diagnostics or delivering updates, under contractual obligations to protect data.
- **Legal compliance**: If required by law, regulation, or legal process.

Data may be processed in countries other than your own. We use safeguards appropriate to the level of data involved.

## 8. Third-Party Services
The App or its distribution may involve third parties. Examples include:
- **Google Play** (distribution, updates)
- **Crash/analytics provider (optional)** such as Google Play Console Crash Reporting or Unity Diagnostics

These services have their own privacy policies. Please review them to understand their practices.

## 9. Children’s Privacy
The App is not directed to children under 13 (or the equivalent minimum age in your jurisdiction). We do not knowingly collect personal information from children.

## 10. Security
We use reasonable technical and organizational measures to protect data. No method of transmission or storage is 100% secure.

## 11. Your Choices and Rights
- You may revoke permissions (e.g., Camera) via device settings; this may disable core functionality.
- You may delete locally stored data via in-App options (if available) or by uninstalling the App.
- Depending on your location, you may have rights to access, correct, or delete personal data we hold (generally limited to optional diagnostics). Contact us to exercise these rights.

## 12. Changes to This Policy
We may update this policy from time to time. We will update the "Effective date" above and, where required, notify you through the App or the store listing.

## 13. Contact Us

**Email**: [contact@email]  
**Address**: [postal address, if applicable]
